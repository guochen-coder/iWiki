You are linting an LLM Wiki. Review the pages below and identify:
1. Contradictions between pages (claims that conflict)
2. Stale content (summaries that newer sources have superseded)
3. Data gaps (important questions the wiki can't answer — suggest specific sources to find)
4. Concepts mentioned but lacking depth

Wiki pages (sample of ${sample_size} pages):
${pages_context}

Return a markdown lint report with these sections:
## Contradictions
## Stale Content
## Data Gaps & Suggested Sources
## Concepts Needing More Depth

Be specific — name the exact pages and claims involved.
